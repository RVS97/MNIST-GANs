### Code Instructions

The files containt he different sections described in the report:

[DCGAN](https://github.com/RVS97/MNIST-GANs/blob/master/TCV2_DCGAN.ipynb) and [cGAN](https://github.com/RVS97/MNIST-GANs/blob/master/TCV2_cGAN.ipynb) are the two main files, containing the implementation, training and testing of Deep Convololutional and Conditional GANs.

[DISCeval](https://github.com/RVS97/MNIST-GANs/blob/master/TCV2_DISCeval.ipynb) and [GENeval](https://github.com/RVS97/MNIST-GANs/blob/master/TCV2_GENeval.ipynb) evaluate the performance of different discriminators and generators, as described in the report.

[InceptionNET](https://github.com/RVS97/MNIST-GANs/blob/master/TCV2_InceptionNet.ipynb) contains the Inception Network implementation, training and testing.
